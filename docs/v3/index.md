# Math

You can customise Just the Docs to support automatic rendering of math formulae in Markdown pages. 
Then just write the formulae in TeX or LaTeX, and enclose them in `$$…$$`;
they will appear on your website as if formatted by applications such as `pdflatex`.

Features:

- Choose between [KaTeX] and [MathJax]
- JavaScript packages – no plugins needed
- Works with Jekyll 3 and Jekyll 4
- Configuration variable, for site-wide availability
- Front-matter variable, for restriction to individual pages
- Layouts support preambles of command/environment definitions
